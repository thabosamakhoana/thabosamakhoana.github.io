I am a PhD candidate in Applied Mathematics and Statistics at Johns Hopkins University. I am fortunate to be advised by Professor [Benjamin Grimmer](https://www.ams.jhu.edu/~grimmer/). Before Johns Hopkins, I obtained my Bachelor of Science in Applied Mathematics from Brown University.

Research Interests
======
Broadly, I work on designing and analyzing algorithms for solving optimization problems on continuous domains. I am particularly interested in algorithms that can be applied to large scale, non-smooth problems.

I am also interested in designing and analyzing algorithms for solving data science problems, with a particular interest in Bayesian methods and uncertainty quantification.
